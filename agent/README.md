# Endar Agent

This folder contains the Endar Agent, a software component designed to run on machines connecting to the Endar server. 

The Endar Agent is written in Go due to its performance and concurrency capabilities. Go also simplifies the creation of cross-platform executables.

Eventually, this project may evolve into its own repository.
